      <p>
        My favourite sport is cricket it is a bat and ball game played between
        players of two teams. Each team has 11 players. Two teams always has set
        of batsmen and bowlers. Its common to have four good batsmen and four
        good bowlers two or three players are usually able to bowl and bat both.

        The cricket ground has diameter of 130m. There is centralised pitch of
        20m having wickets on both sides. On wickets there are stumps. The one
        side wickets are specified for bowling and other side is specified for
        bating.

      <h2>Types of matches</h2>
      <p>
        There are three different types of matches in cricket. There is test
        match in which opponent team will bowl until all players are bowled. One
        day match has 50 overs. One team gives target of runs and opponent team
        has to achieve it within 50 overs. Most famous type if 20-20 in which
        teams are bounded for 20 overs.
