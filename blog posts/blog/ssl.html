      <h1>SSl</h1>
      <p>
        SSL stands for secure socket layer. SSL is a technology used to secure
        data between two connections (Two connections can be a webpage and it’s
        user). SSL makes it impossible to see the data transferred between two
        connections. SSL secures sensitive information by using encryption
        algorithms. For example, during online shopping, all your financial and
        personal information is protected by SSL. TSL (Transport Layer Security
        ) is a modified form of SSL. But still, SSL is a commonly used term. In
        TLS, encryption is used to secure important data, the same as in SSL.
        During online searches, some websites are shown by URL http:// while
        others with https:// . The URL starting with https:// shows that the
        website is protected by an SSL layer.

      <h2>Encryption</h2>
      <p>
        Encryption is encoding of sensitive information to protect your privacy
        from unauthorized users. A Cipher is generated using letters, numbers
        and symbols. Characters in Cipher are standing in for original data. No
        one will be able to see your data without a decryption key. Encryption
        has two types. Symmetric encryption is the first type, and it has the
        same encryption and decryption key. Asymmetric encryption differentiates
        itself from symmetric encryption, as encryption and decryption keys are
        different. Encryption is a very essential part of data privacy. A huge
        part of private information is shared online including personal and
        financial. Organizations having private data must use encryption and
        other methods to protect their users' information. Digital Security is
        gaining more importance as we are banking and shopping online.

      <h2>SSL Certificate Authority</h2>
      <p>
        Prefixes HTTP or HTTPS are a matter of great concern when you are
        talking about secure websites. Online shopping businesses and other
        governmental organizations always use SSL secured websites. Before using
        your information online, it’s advisable to check (that website is
        secured by SSL. SSL Certificate Authority (CA) are organizations that
        provide SSL certificates. CAs are trustable organizations that help to
        protect websites and its users' privacy. Main duty of CAs is to issue
        digital certificates and set up trust between the website and its users.
        CAs issue private keys and public keys. Private keys are confidential
        (even not shared to CAs). CAs take a fee to complete the process.
        Digital certificates issued contain information about the organization
        like name, contact information, public, expiry data and more. Digital
        signatures are signed by CAs on Digital certificates.
