      <h1>Password Management</h1>
      <p>
        Password management is the technique a person must follow in order to
        stay secure. These techniques require an individual to create passwords
        that are difficult for the other to guess. Although simple passwords are
        easy to memorize they put a person in a vulnerable position where they
        are more likely to get hacked. Using the same password everywhere has
        become a common practice. This is also something that can make it easier
        for someone to get hacked.
      </p>
      <h2>Rules to create Passwords</h2>
      <p>
        When creating accounts on websites, you are typically given a set of
        rules to follow when creating a password. These rules help make sure
        your passwords are difficult, making your account more secure. Using
        uppercase letters and numbers is common. However, sometimes these rules
        are difficult to follow since you might be required to use various
        symbols and have a certain number of characters. But these are the
        things that will ensure safety and privacy.
      </p>
      <h2>Commonly Used Passwords</h2>
      <p>
        Passwords play the role of keeping a person’s information confidential.
        This information can be something minor like photos on social media, or
        something major like banking. This is why websites or institutions have
        a set of rules a person must follow when creating their passwords. These
        rules help make passwords difficult for others to guess. Commonly used
        passwords include a person’s name, last name, age, birthday as well as
        simple numbers like “0000” or “1234.” These passwords are common because
        they are easy to remember. Four percent of users use the top 100
        passwords that are common.
      </p>
      <h2>Securing Your Passwords</h2>
      <p>
        A good way to remember your passwords and keep them secure is by writing
        them down. Written passwords are easily approachable and kept private so
        that no one else can see them. One more approachable way to keep
        passwords safe is using a password manager. Password manager keeps your
        passwords secure and you don’t need to secure them on the browser.
        Password manager creates strong passwords that are difficult to get
        hacked and you don’t even need to memorize them.
